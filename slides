Goals
* Branching Refresher
* <a href="http://nvie.com/files/Git-branching-model.pdf">Git Flow</a>
* Strategies for both code and SQL repositories
* Allow us to work on version 2.0 while maintaining 1.x in a parallel track

!BULLETS
Branching Refresher
* Branches are created from a specific commit of another branch, normally <b><i>master</i></b>
* Branches are used to isolate development without affecting the branch that is used for publishing

!BULLETS
Git Flow Branching
* Working in a different branch will not change your workflow. 
* Code, commit and push (Sync) are the same.
* However, push becomes optional with Git Flow. 
* Most of the time, we will not Sync to github.com.
* One more step when the development is complete: <b><i>merge</i></b>

<h1>Branching Strategy</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Git Branching is known for being:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Simple</li>
		<li>Lightweight</li>
		<li>Useful</li>
	</ul>
	<li><strong>master</strong> is the default branch</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Therefore the one we normally work on</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Say hello to the <strong>develop</strong> branch</li>
	<li>Get used to <strong>Feature-</strong> and <strong>BugFix-</strong> branches</li>
</ul>

!COMMANDLINE
